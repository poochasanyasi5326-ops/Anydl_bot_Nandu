> ⚠️ Only the owner can use it

## ⚠️ Railway Torrent Usage Warning

Railway does **not officially support P2P traffic**.

What this means in practice:
- Small, well-seeded torrents usually work
- Slow or large torrents may fail
- High bandwidth usage may trigger throttling
- Containers can restart without notice

### Recommended usage
- Prefer torrents under **2–3 GB**
- Use well-seeded public torrents
- Monitor progress with `/status`
- Stop early if progress is slow

Failures here are **platform-level**, not code bugs.

---

## 🐳 Docker Notes

- The file must be named **exactly** `Dockerfile`
- No file extension (`.py`, `.txt`, etc.)
- Railway builds automatically using Docker
